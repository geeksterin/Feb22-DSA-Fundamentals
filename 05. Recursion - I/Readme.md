##                       Recursion - I
----------------------------------------------------------------
1. What is Recursion from coding perspective 
2. Recursion from a Mathematical perspective.
3. What is base condition in recursion? 
4. Types of recursion: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-recursions/ 
5. Revisiting memory allocation on stack.
6. Why Stack Overflow error occurs in recursion
7. Visualising Recursion via tree with eg fib no.

8. Post order traversal aka head recursion.
9. Call stack vs. Recursion Tree.



Head Recursion: We pospond the tasks in favour of making function calls. And while returning back we take up these tasks and execute them. 
- It's a lazy execution 
- Post-order execution.

Tail Recursion: 
- It's a eger execution model.
- Pre-order execution.



###             Foundational Coding Question on Recursion: 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-   Printing no 1 to n
-   Printing no from n to 1
-   Finding a element x in an array using recursion.
-   Finding minimum in a array using recursion.
-   Finding maximum in a array using recursion. [x]
-   Check if the array  isSorted or not.


-   Factorial of a number.
-   Fibonacci number.
    - Tribonnaci Number [x]

-   GCD(a,b) using recursion. aka Euclid's Algorithm.
    - Does dividend > divisor ALWAYS??
    - GCD of 3 numbers.=> gcd(gcd(a,b),c) why does it work?
    - To get the minimum fraction=> a/b => a/(gcd(a,b)) / b /(gcd(a,b))
    - TC of Euclid's Algorithm.

-   Pow(a,b) using recursion.
    - Normal recusive function pow(a,b)
    - recursive function: 
    - pow(a,-b) [x]



-   Sum of digits using recursion
-   Finding first and last Occurance of 'a' char in "abcdefabcdef"
-   Move all X's to end of the String.
-   Recursive Binary search.
-   Check if the given string is a palindrome using recursion.
-   Sorting a stack using recursion.
-   Reverse the number using recursion.
