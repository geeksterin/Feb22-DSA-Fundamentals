### Master's Theorem on Divide and Conquer
---------------------------------------------------------------
``` T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n)
    where: n = size of input
           a = number of subproblems in the recursion / constant
           n/b = size of each subproblem. All subproblems are assumed to have the same size.
           f(n) = cost of the work done outside the recursive call, which includes the cost of dividing the problem and cost of merging the solutions 
Here, a â‰¥ 1 and b > 1 are constants, and f(n) is an asymptotically positive function.
